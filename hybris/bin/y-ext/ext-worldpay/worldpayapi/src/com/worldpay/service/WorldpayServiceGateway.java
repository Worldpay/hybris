/**
 * This class forms the main gateway for users into the Worldpay back-end systems.
 * <p/>
 * <p>There are convenience methods for making the following calls through to Worldpay:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Direct Authorise - To be used to authorise funds if your site is PCI compliant. Expects the payment details to be provided along with all the other authorisation
 * details like amount, shopper and shipping details. Use the convenience methods in {@link DirectAuthoriseServiceRequest} to create the request. The same call should be used
 * to pass in the 3D details if 3D authentication is needed.</li>
 * <li>Redirect Authorise - To be used to initialise the authorisation of funds if your site is not PCI compliant. Relevant payment methods can be passed in as a
 * payment method mask either as an include list, an exclude list or both. If mac validation is enabled then this is also carried out to ensure the mac code in the returned
 * url has not been tampered with. Use the convenience method in {@link RedirectAuthoriseServiceRequest} to create the request.</li>
 * <li>Capture - To be used to capture the funds. Provide the order code and the amount. Use the convenience method in {@link CaptureServiceRequest} to create the request.</li>
 * <li>Cancel - To be used to cancel the authorisation of funds. Cannot be invoked once the capture has taken place. Simply provide the order code. Use the convenience method in
 * {@link CancelServiceRequest} to create the request.</li>
 * <li>Refund - To be used to refund the captured funds. Any amount up to the original authorised amount can be refunded. Provide the order code and the amount to be refunded.
 * Use the convenience method in {@link RefundServiceRequest} to create the request.</li>
 * <li>Add Back Office Code - To be used to add the back office code. Provide the order code and the back office code. Use the convenience method in {@link AddBackOfficeCodeServiceRequest}
 * to create the request.</li>
 * <li>Authorisation Code - To be used to add the authorisation code. Provide the order code and the authorisation code. Use the convenience method in {@link AuthorisationCodeServiceRequest}
 * to create the request. </li>
 * <li>Order Inquiry - To be used to make inquiry against an order and find out the latest status in Worldpay. Provide the order code. Use the convenience method in
 * {@link OrderInquiryServiceResponse} to create the request.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each call follows roughly the same steps of transforming the {@link ServiceRequest} object into an internal model representation of the payment service.
 * Then validating that this will produce well formed xml against the schema. Sending this xml to Worldpay. Receiving the response xml and building this into
 * an internal model representation of the reply. Finally the internal model is transformed back into a {@link ServiceResponse} to be returned to any implementers</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The same framework can be extended by injecting a {@link ServiceRequestTransformer} into the {@code requestTransformerStrategyMap}, and a {@link ServiceResponseTransformer}
 * into the {@code responseTransformerStrategyMap}. This allows further methods to be added and still use all the underlying framework for transforming, validating, sending
 * and receiving the xml</p>
